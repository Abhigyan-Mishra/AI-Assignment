## Quantum Assisted Genetic Algorithm to find best feature subset:

**generations**  :  Number of generations

**num** : Size of the chromosomes

**num_pop** : Number of chromosomes for each pop

**rotations** : Dictionary that saves the rotation to apply at each generation and its updated based on the evaluation (for each gene).

**func** : The function we are trying to optimize

**delta** : The degree by which the theta(Rotational Parameter) changes 

**mutation_rate** : The probability that has used for deciding the extend of mutation

**crossover_probability** : Probability of crossover(Single Point) between parents
